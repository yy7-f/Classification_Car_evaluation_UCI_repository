# Classification_Car_evaluation_UCI_repository

The car evaluation dataset from UCI repository contains 1728 car information with the rating as the target variable
and 6 feature variables. The target variable (rating) is ‘unacc’, ‘acc’, ‘good', or ‘vgood'. The classification goal is to predict the class value of a particular car based on the vehicle’s features.

Categorical data was encoded followed by order. Three algorithms including k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and random forest are executed with 10-fold cross-validation. The results are visualized and compared using confusion matrices and box plots.
